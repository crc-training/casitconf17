# Crafting Reusable Infrastructure Resources 

Are you trying to define your infrastructure into code but unclear about how to get your coworkers involved? Maybe you've learned the primitives and architecture of Chef, Puppet or other configuration management tools, but you're not sure how to distill that knowledge into patterns that others can follow? In this collaborative training, we will work together to craft infrastructure into code from scratch using Git, Chef, Docker, Jenkins, and other commonly used tools. In the process, we'll learn some key patterns of DevOps practices.

* Application deployment planning.
* Introducing repeatable, testable change.
* Measuring impact and quality.
